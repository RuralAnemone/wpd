	<h1>pasge 2!!!!</h1>
	<p>
		The season of life that I am most looking forward to is moving out and finally living on my own.
		<br>
		...as well as getting a job in software.
		<br>
		Marriage is also a goal, but that's not until like at least June '26.
		<br>
		If you know me well enough you know exactly why that is (:
