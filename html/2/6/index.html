	<h2>my most memorable season of life:</h2>
	<p>
		My most memorable season of life was when I went to the <a href="https://youth.ag.org/Participate/Fine-Arts/"><strong>National Fine Arts Festival</strong></a> <em>(all three times, but especially last year, 2023)</em>.
		It was fun presenting my pieces and hanging out with friends.
		Both of my teams got 2nd round callbacks, which I didn't expect.
		Our <a href="javascript:alert('I could not find the video, unfortunately')">human video performance</a> was especially fun to be in.
		Also, a friend and I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Mu5oeiwIuYlzNnkZVIdHuT3Xu37mKILnNLDlakKRAw/edit">a card game</a> at 3 in the morning and have been playtesting it ever since.
	</p>
	<p>oh right, some memories:</p>

		<li>presenting pieces</li>
