			<h6>by Mark Z. Danielewski</h6>

		<hr>
		<p id="main"><em><span class="house">House</span> of Leaves</em> is a critically acclaimed novel that challenges the traditional structure of storytelling through its unconventional formatting and complex narrative. Its unique approach to storytelling can be compared to the performance of a skilled artist, pushing the boundaries of what is expected and leaving a lasting impression on its audience.</p>
		<p>What I love about <span class="house">House</span> of Leaves is how it immerses the reader in a world of mystery and intrigue. The story is full of unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat, and the unconventional formatting adds to the overall sense of disorientation and unease. It's a book that challenges you to think outside the box and question your own perceptions of reality, and I find that incredibly compelling.</p>
