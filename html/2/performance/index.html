		<h2>a bio of sorts</h2>

	<main>
		<p class="h7">name</p>
		<p>hi! my name is Isaiah.</p>

		<p class="h7">background info</p>
		<p>I grew up in Minnesota and have lived there my entire life.</p>

		<p class="h7">hobbies & interests outside of school</p>
		<p>some of my hobbies and interests outside of school include programming for fun (working on the website for The Skewer), finding niche retro video games, and playing the piano.</p>

		<p class="h7">plans after high school</p>
		<p>
			my plans after high school are to <em>not</em> go to college, but instead find work right away and use my previous knowledge alongside my (hopefully) completed CS50 course to get a job in the tech industry.
			I'd like to get into wither software engineering or web development, but I'm kinda open to most programming jobs at the moment.
			I just joined Robotics as a programmer (FRC3407), so that should be some nice resum√© candy.
		</p>

		<p class="h7">current or past work experience</p>
		<p>I've worked at a local farm for the past few years, at Fresh and Natural Foods before it closed in September 2022, and over the summer I worked at the State Fair.</p>

		<p class="h7">dream vacation</p>
		<p>I really haven't thought about this that much, though I'd probably like to go to Australia or New Zealand at some point. I've always found Oceania to have really interesting culture and history.</p>
