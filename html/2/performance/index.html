			<h2>a bio of sorts</h2>
			<h5>(by me)</h5>
		</header>
		<main>
			<p class="h7">name</p>
			<p>hi! my name is Isaiah.</p>

			<p class="h7">background info</p>
			<p>I grew up in Minnesota and have lived there my entire life.</p>

			<p class="h7">hobbies & interests outside of school</p>
			<p>
				some of my hobbies and interests outside of school include programming for fun (working on the website for The
				Skewer), finding niche retro video games, and playing the piano.
			</p>

			<p class="h7">plans after high school</p>
			<p>
				my plans after high school are to <em>not</em> go to college, but instead find work right away and use my
				previous knowledge alongside my (hopefully) completed CS50 course to get a job in the tech industry. I'd like to
				get into wither software engineering or web development, but I'm kinda open to most programming jobs at the
				moment. I just joined Robotics as a programmer (FRC3407), so that should be some nice resumé candy.
			</p>

			<p class="h7">current or past work experience</p>
			<p>
				I've worked at a local farm for the past few years, at Fresh and Natural Foods before the Shoreview location closed in September
				2022, and over the summer I worked at the State Fair.
			</p>

			<p class="h7">dream vacation</p>
			<p>
				I really haven't thought about this that much, though I'd probably like to go to Australia or New Zealand at
				some point. I've always found Oceania to have really interesting culture and history.
			</p>
			<p>if you'd like to learn more about the Oceania area, please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania" target="_blank">here</a> or click the map below.</p>

				I don't have <em>a</em> favorite quote, but please enjoy instead a small collection of my favorite

			<p class="h7">pets (past, present, & future)</p>
			<p>I have had six pets in the past.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Sally &mdash; a German Shorthaired Pointer mutt. I know this is cliché but she was literally the best dog ever. Died on May 6th, 2017 from sodium pentobaribital, lest she die of liver failure.</p></li>
				<li><p>Rosie &mdash; a Rhodesian Ridgeback/Boxer/probably some lab mutt. We got her shortly after Sally died, but she was <em>a bit</em> aggressive so we had to return her or something idk I didn't pay too much attention I was still grieving</p></li>
				<li><p>Кошка &mdash; a Chinese Dwarf Hamster. so there. very uneventful life.</p></li>
				<li><p>Blue &mdash; a black American Shorthair that "follwed my mom and sisters home" from their stay at Blue Mounds State Park in September 2017. He was incredible; very photogenic, loved hunting but also cuddling, etc. not that I'd pick favorites, but he was definitely my favorite (:</p>
				<img src="img/blue-on-chair.webp" alt="blue on a patio chair; moody stare towards upper left">
				<img src="img/blue-on-driveway.webp" alt="blue on the driveway, stretchin'">
				<p>unfortunately got hit by a car on May 7th this year so that's not fun</p>
				<p>anyways we got some new mousers recently, and they're getting to be some fine bois:</p></li>
				<li>
					<p>Peter &mdash; tuxedo flavored cat (see <a href="../4/" target="_blank">2.4</a>)</p>
					<img src="img/petr.jpg" alt="peter on grass idk">
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Andrew &mdash; Garfield knock off (see <a href="../4/" target="_blank">2.4</a>)</p>
					<img src="img/andr.jpg" alt="andrew the cat I guess">
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="h7">favorite ice cream flavor</p>
			<p>I really like Big Dipper's Licorice flavor, though if I want people to perceive me as slightly more sane I'd probably go with Rum Cherry.</p>

			<p class="h7">something I'm really good at doing</p>
			<p>I'm pretty good at playing the piano. I've been playing and taking lessons for 12 years now, and I think it shows.</p>

			<p class="h7">something I'm terrible at (subjectively)</p>
			<p>I don't know if there's anything I'm <em>terrible</em> at; if there's anything I'm &quot;terrible&quot; at it's just because I haven't learned how to do it well (or at all) yet. That's generally my mindset for most things.</p>
