# Unit 4: Passion Project

main goals:

- learn [Haskell](https://haskell.org)

	- to a level that I'm comfortable doing [leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) with it

- use that knowledge to learn the [Miso](https://haskell-miso.org/) API

- use *that* knowledge to build a website

	- what though? a writeup of what I've learned? that wouldn't be a very goood use of the API

	- what if I make a Markdown renderer

	- yeah
